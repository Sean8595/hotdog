All Dogs go to Kevin is an APP that keeps track of what hotdogs have been eaten and which ones have yet to be eaten
User inputs into a textbox what hotdog they add to the list or select from a pre-selected set to eat.
User presses the "Eated" button and it is moved to "Nom Nom", changing the value from true to false
The user can press the "Gross" button to move it back to the original column.
